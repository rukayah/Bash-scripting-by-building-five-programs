# Creating 5 programs with Bash Scripting

# Description
The script files in the project are designed to create a program that performs various tasks, from asking basic questions to counting down from a number to zero, all using Bash. The project aims to test the knowledge of Bash scripting.


The first program is contained in the questionnaire.sh file. A program that when run will ask questions such as your name, location, favourite colour, and greets.

## Project still in progress.
